# Personalized Wellness AI 🧠💪

This project is a lightweight Machine Learning proof-of-concept that demonstrates how synthetic data can be used to provide personalized wellness recommendations based on daily activity, sleep patterns, diet, and stress.

## 📊 Features Used
- Daily Steps (`daily_steps`)
- Sleep Duration (`sleep_hours`)
- Stress Level (`stress_level`)
- Mood Score (`mood_score`)
- Diet Quality (`diet_quality`)

## 🔍 Goal
To predict a user's `mood_score` using their wellness-related data and generate useful insights through visualizations.

## 🧪 Machine Learning
- **Model Used**: Linear Regression
- **Why?**: Simple, fast, interpretable — perfect for a proof-of-concept
- **Evaluation Metric**: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

## 📁 Files
- `ml_wellness_project_DweepPatil.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook with code, charts, and explanation
- `synthetic_wellness_data.csv` — The generated data
- `sleep_vs_mood.png` & `mood_distribution.png` — Visuals for insight

## ✅ How to Run
1. Clone this repo or download the ZIP
2. Open `ml_wellness_project_DweepPatil.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run all cells to explore the full analysis

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is a demo using **synthetic data**. Not intended for real-world health decision-making.
